  "Search for a path from `start` to a goal using Aâ˜….

  The following parameters are all required:

  * `start`: the starting state.

  * `neighbors`: a function that takes a state and returns all states reachable
    from it.

  * `goalp`: a predicate that takes a state and returns whether it is a goal.

  * `cost`: a function that takes two states `a` and `b` and returns the cost
    to move from `a` to `b`.

  * `heuristic`: a function that takes a state and estimates the distance
    remaining to the goal.

  * `test`: an equality predicate for comparing nodes.  It must be suitable for
    passing to `make-hash-table`.

  If the heuristic function is admissable (i.e. it never overestimates the
  remaining distance) the algorithm will find the shortest path.

  Note that `test` is required.  The only sensible default would be `eql`, but
  if you were using states that need a different predicate and forgot to pass it
  the algorithm would end up blowing the heap, which is unpleasant.
